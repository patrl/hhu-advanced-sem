\section{Reading for next week}
\label{sec:org932ab49}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapters 1 and 2 of \autocite{HeimKratzer1998}, i.e., up to the end of \textbf{Executing the Fregean Program}.
\end{itemize}
\section{Truth-conditions and compositionality}
\label{sec:org85d386b}

\begin{itemize}
\item Conjecture: to know the meaning of a sentence is to know its \emph{truth-conditions} (Alfred Tarski).
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex The sentence ``snow is white'' is true if and only if snow is white.
\label{org9c5392f}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item More general schema (as long as both the object language and the meta-language are the same):
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex The sentence ``\(\_\_\_\)'' is true if and only if \(\_\_\_\)
\label{org99b00c0}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item Is this trivial/circular?
\begin{itemize}
\item One way of understanding this conjecture: semantic competence involves ``knowing'' the associations between particular sentences and ways in which the world can be (as described by the meta-language).
\item Crucially, we know the truth-conditions of sentences we've never heard before.
\item Semantic competence can't amount to just learning associations of sentences-meanings, since the meanings of sentences relate to the meanings of their parts in systematic ways (Gottlob Frege).
\end{itemize}
\item How are meanings put together? Frege's conjecture was that certain meanings are 'incomplete'; in his terms \emph{unsaturated}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
``Statements in general, just like equations or inequalities or expressions in
Analysis, can be imagined to be split up into two parts; one complete in
itself, and the other in need of supplementation, or ''unsaturated.`` Thus,
e.g., we split up the sentence ''Caesar conquered Gaul`` into '' Caesar`` and ''conquered Gaul.`` The second part is ''unsaturated`` - it contains an empty place; only when this place is filled up with a proper name, or with an expression that replaces a proper name, does a complete sense appear. Here too I give the name ''function`` to what this ''unsaturated`` part stands for. In this case the argument is Caesar.''\\[0pt]
-- Frege
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item Frege models the notion of an ``unsaturated'' meaning as a function looking for an argument.
\end{itemize}
\section{Formal preliminaries}
\label{sec:orgb72170d}

\subsection{Sets}
\label{sec:org113fcb2}

\begin{itemize}
\item A set \(A\) is a collection of objects called \emph{members} or \emph{elements} of the set; \(x\) is an element of \(A\) is written \(x \in A\).
\item Sets may have finitely, or infinitely many members.
\item Sets are identified with their members; there is exactly one set with no members: the \emph{empty set}, written \(\emptyset\).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Set relations}
\label{sec:org376891b}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two sets are equal \(A = B\) if \(A\) and \(B\) have the same members.
\begin{itemize}
\item The order in which members are written doesn't matter for set equality.
\end{itemize}
\item \(A\) is a subset of \(B\) \(A \subseteq B\), if \(\forall x \in A\), \(x \in B\).
\item Which of the following statements (if any) are true?
\begin{itemize}
\item For any set \(A\), \(\emptyset \in A\).
\item For any set \(A\), \(\emptyset \subseteq A\).
\item For any set \(A\), \(A \subseteq A\).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item \(A\) is a \emph{strict} subset of \(B\), \(A \subset B\), if \(A \subseteq B\), and \(A \neq B\).
\item \(A\) is a superset of \(B\), \(A \supseteq B\), if \(B \subseteq A\).
\begin{itemize}
\item Strict supersethood \(A \sup B\) has the obvious definition (what is it?).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Set operations}
\label{sec:org19899ae}

\begin{itemize}
\item \(x \in A \cap B\) (the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\)) iff \(x \in A\) and \(x \in  B\).
\item \(x \in A \cup B\) (the union of \(A\) and \(B\)) iff \(x \in A\) or \(x \in  B\).
\item \(x \in  B - A\) (the complement of \(A\) in \(B\)) iff \(x \in  B\) and \(x \notin A\).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Defining sets}
\label{sec:orgff102f0}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sets can be defined extensionally by explicitly listing their members:
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \(A \coloneq \set{a,b,c}\)
\label{orgfd1fe01}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sets can be defined intensionally using abstraction notation:
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \(A := \set{x : x\text{ is a cat} }\)
\label{orgee571aa}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item \(a \in \set{ x | \phi }\) iff \(\phi[x \to a]\) is true.\footnote{\(\phi[x \to a]\) is to be understood as the statement \(\phi\), where all occurrences of the variable \(x\) in \(\phi\) have been replaced with \(a\).}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Questions}
\label{sec:org12bffe1}

\begin{itemize}
\item If the \(x\) in \(\set{x : x\text{ is a positive integer less than }7 }\) is a place-holder, why do we need it at all? Why don't we just write \(\set{\_ : \_ \text{is a positive integer less than }7 }\)?
\item Consider the following sets. Which one(s) corresponds to \emph{the set of objects which don't like anything}, and which one corresponds to \emph{the set of objects which nothing likes}?
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\set{x : \set{y : x\text{ likes }y } = \emptyset }\)
\item \(\set{x : \set{y : y\text{ likes }x } = \emptyset }\)
\item \(\set{y : \set{x : x\text{ likes y} } = \emptyset }\)
\end{itemize}
\item Why do we need the variable to the left of the colon? Why can't we just write \(\set{x\text{ is a positive integer less than }7 }\).
\item What does the following mean? \(\set{\text{California} :\text{California is a western state}  }\)
\item What about the following? \(\set{x : \text{California is a western state} }\)
\item Evaluate whether the following is true, and show your reasoning: \(29 \in  \set{x : x \in \set{x : x \neq \emptyset }}\).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exercise}
\label{sec:org65a2211}

In each case, say whether or not the equality holds:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\set{a} = \set{b}\)
\item \(\set{x : x = a} = \set{a}\)
\item \(\set{x : x\text{ is green} } = \set{y : y\text{ is green} }\)
\item \(\set{x : x\text{ likes }a } = \set{y : y\text{ likes }b }\)
\item \(\set{x : x \in A} = A\)
\item \(\set{x : x \in  \set{y : y \in  B}} = B\)
\item \(\set{x : \set{y : y\text{ likes }x } = \emptyset } = \set{x : \set{x : x\text{ likes }x } = \emptyset }\)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Functions}
\label{sec:org848480b}

\begin{itemize}
\item An \emph{ordered pair} of \(x,y\), written \(<x,y>\).
\begin{itemize}
\item \(<x,y> \neq <y,x>\) (if \(x \neq y\)).
\end{itemize}
\item A \emph{relation} is a set of ordered pairs.
\item A \emph{function} is a special kind of relation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textbf{Functions (def.):} A relation \(f\) is a \emph{function} iff it satisfies the following condition: for any \(x\): if there are \(y,z\) s.t., \(<x,y> \in f\), and \(<x,z> \in  f\), then \(y = z\).
\label{org1b9e58e}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{domain} of a function \(f\) is \(\set{x : \text{there is a }y\text{ such that }<x,y> \in f  }\).
\item The \emph{range} of \(f\) is \(\set{x : \text{there is a }y\text{ such that }<y,x> \in  f  }\).
\item When \(A\) is the domain, and \(B\) the range of \(f\), \(f\) is a function ``from \(A\) onto \(B\), written \(f : A \rightarrow B\)''.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex \textbf{Mathematical notation for functions (def.):}\\[0pt]
\(f(x) := \text{the unique }y\text{ s.t. }<x,y> \in f\)
\label{org1f9f792}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item \(f(x)\) is pronounced ``\(f\) applied to \(x\)'', or ``\(f\) of \(x\)''. We'll usually write \(f(x) = y\) instead of (equivalently) \(<x,y> \in f\).
\item Two different ways of writing functions extensionally:
\end{itemize}

\[f := \set{<a,b>,<c,b>,<d,e>}\]

\[f := \left[\begin{aligned}[c]
a \to b\\
c \to b\\
d \to e
\end{aligned}\right]\]

\begin{itemize}
\item Different ways of writing function \emph{intensions}:
\end{itemize}

\begin{exe}
\ex Let \(f_{+1}\) be that function \(f\) s.t. \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\), and for every \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), \(f(n) = n + 1\).
\label{orgf6df84a}
\end{exe}
\section{Executing the Fregean program}
\label{sec:orgad5183e}

\begin{exe}
  \ex
  \begin{forest}
    [{S}
      [{NP} [{N} [{Ann}]]]
      [{VP} [{V} [{smokes}]]]
    ]\end{forest}
\end{exe}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fregean denotation of a sentence: a truth value; a member of the set \(\set{0,1}\).
\item Another word for a Fregean denotation: an \emph{extension}.
\item Extensions of proper names: individuals. The extension of ``Ann'' is \textbf{Ann}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Components of a fragment}
\label{sec:org52d18bb}

\begin{enumerate}
\item An inventory of denotations (``the model'').
\begin{itemize}
\item Things that linguistic expressions can get mapped to.
\end{itemize}
\item The lexicon.
\begin{itemize}
\item Denotations for each expressions which may occupy a terminal node.
\end{itemize}
\item Semantic rules.
\begin{itemize}
\item Rules that allow us to compute the determine the denotation for each kind o non-terminal node.
\end{itemize}

\item The \emph{interpretation function} \(\eval{.}\) is a function from the set of linguistic expression onto the set of possible denotations.
\begin{itemize}
\item By giving a total definition of the interpretation function for (i) lexical items, and (ii) non-terminal nodes, we provide the lexicon and the semantic rules respectively.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{A concrete example}
\label{sec:orgb778941}

\textbf{Exercise:} prove the following claim:

\[\eval*{\begin{array}{c}
\begin{forest}
    [{S}
      [{NP} [{N} [{Ann}]]]
      [{VP} [{V} [{smokes}]]]
    ]\end{forest}
\end{array}} = 1\text{ iff Ann smokes}\]
